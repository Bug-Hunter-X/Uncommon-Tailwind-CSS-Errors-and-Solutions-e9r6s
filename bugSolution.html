The solution often involves ensuring that Tailwind directives are applied within the correct scope.  This often means wrapping elements within a template or a component which Tailwind is configured to process.  If using a framework like Vue.js, make sure Tailwind is correctly integrated and that the components where you use Tailwind classes are properly setup to be processed. Check your Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or similar) to ensure it's correctly set up and includes any necessary plugins or configurations for your framework. Avoid conflicts with custom directives, carefully naming and scoping these directives to ensure they do not inadvertently overwrite Tailwind classes.  Ensure the Tailwind plugin is correctly installed and configured within your framework's build process.
